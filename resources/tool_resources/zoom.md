Many of our interactions may be in Zoom this semester. Some things to know:

1. Zoom links for the various TA's when they are holding their TA hours can be found in the "TA Hours" link in the webpage sidebar.

2. You need to attend each lab either in person or via zoom. In-lab quizzes are given to help you check your understanding before you start your design.

3. If you are unable to attend due to illness or other reasons, you may join the Lab Zoom Meeting (see "TA Hours" link in sidebar for address) to watch the professor's introduction to the lab. You may then complete the assignment either in the lab or on your own laptop.

4. When you join make sure your microphone is off.

5. Use the "Raise Your Hand" option in Zoom if you want to ask a question.

6. If you want to meet with Prof Nelson, the majority of his office hours will be handled using Zoom. See the "TA Hours" link in the sidebar for the address.
