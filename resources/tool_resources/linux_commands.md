For more information on the following commands, type `man` and the name of the command to see a help manual for that command. You can open another terminal window at the same time to type the `man` command and see the helpful text. Some commands, like `alias`, are built into bash. For these, type `man bash` to get help. If you type `man <command>` and the response is `No manual entry for <command>`, it is likely built into bash. Online help is also available for [shell built-in commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html) and other [core commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html).
