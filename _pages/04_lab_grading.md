As per the syllabus, the labs will be worth 30% of your final grade in the course.

## Grade Breakdown
This will be broken down as follows:

* Each lab will be worth an equal amount
* Each lab grade will be broken down into:
  * 80% pass-off
  * 20% online lab report, submitted through Learning Suite
    * For labs where you submit your SystemVerilog code (all labs except 1 and 2), half of the online lab report grade will be based on your adherence to coding standard.

## Coding Standard Grading
Read the [SystemVerilog Coding Standard]({% link _pages/03_coding_standard.md %})!

The TAs will apply the following grading rubric when evaluating your SystemVerilog source code. The goal is to get you in the habit of writing, readable, reusable, high-quality code. As such the TAs will be quite strict when grading your code.
* You start out with 100% credit (10 points) for the code-quality part of your grade. If the lab consists of submitting multiple SystemVerilog modules, they will be worth a combined 10 points (as indicated in Learning Suite).
* Each coding infraction reduces the code-quality credit by 1 point. Making the “same mistake multiple times” will result in losing multiple points. (e.g. if your `always_comb` is missing default values for multiple signals assigned in the block, you will be deducted 1 point for each signal that does not have a default value).

## Videos
If you are asked to attach a video to your project, please do it as follows.
* Upload it to one of YouTube, Dropbox, Google Drive, or Box.
* Enter the link where the TA's can find it instead of actually uploading your video to Learning Suite.
* If your link is broken the TA will likely email you for a correct link in the early labs. Later in the semester, if the link doesn't work you may not receive credit.

Of the above sites, YouTube is pretty painless but any will work.
