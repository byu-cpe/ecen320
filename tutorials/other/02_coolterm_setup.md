CoolTerm is a serial console, a computer program that can listen for and display characters sent over a serial link. You will use it if you are using your Mac and LabConnect to work this semester. If you are using either a Windows machine or you are using a Mac but with a Linux VM then you should go read the Putty tutorial since that would be the program to use for those use models.

A serial console program like CoolTerm is used in the UART labs so the Basys 3 and the computer can communicate with each other over USB serial communication.

The usage of CoolTerm is very similar to the use of PuTTY on a Windows or Linux machine so you may find those tutorials useful as well as you learn how to do things. However, to help you set it up, a video was created giving a quick demo. It is below:
