* Emailing the file to yourself is the easiest way to scan a file. On the home screen tap **Email** and type in your email address. There is a physical keyboard you can slide out of the bottom to type faster.

* Open the lid, place in whatever you want to scan and press the big green button to scan. It will automatically email it to you! You can then copy the image out of your email and place it in your lab write-up.

## Hints
* For scanning homework, you'll need to change the Document File Type to PDF.
* You can scan multiple pages by turning on **Job Build**, found on Page 3 of the options.
