title: Using CAEDM Storage (J Drive)
lab: 1
---

Each CAEDM account holder has access to an online storage drive called the J Drive. Your J Drive can only be accessed by you.

It is highly recommended that you use the J Drive for all your labs. Files saved on the J Drive will never be deleted whereas there is no guarantee that files saved on an individual lab computer will be there the next time you use it.

## On Campus Access
All the lab computers have automatic access to your J Drive after you log in. Simply go to **My Computer** and find the J: drive under Network Locations.

If the J drive doesn't show up automatically when it should, you can add it by following [this guide](https://caedm.et.byu.edu/wiki/index.php5/J_Drive#Accessing_the_J_Drive_from_On_Campus). Follow the **My Computer Method** under **Windows Machines**.

## Off Campus Access
You can access your J Drive on any computer off campus through your CAEDM account. Follow [this guide](https://caedm.et.byu.edu/wiki/index.php5/J_Drive#Accessing_the_J_Drive_from_Off_Campus) to do so. You can also SSH into your J Drive with [this guide](https://caedm.et.byu.edu/wiki/index.php5/SSH).

Students sometimes encounter VPN problems accessing the J drive from off campus. If this happens to you and the TA's cannot help, you should contact CAEDM support immediately for help.
