title: Creating a CAEDM Account
lab: 1
---

In order to complete the laboratories in this class, you will need to have an account on the CAEDM computing system. CAEDM is the organization within the college of Engineering and Technology that manages the computing infrastructure and software that is used by all departments and schools in the college 1). You will likely need a CAEDM account for other courses you take within the college.

A CAEDM account is required to access any of the lab computers in the Clyde Building. It also gives you access to many features such as the J Drive, which you will learn to use later in [another tutorial]({% link tutorials/lab_01/02_using_the_j_drive.md %}). To make a CAEDM account, [follow this link](https://caedm.et.byu.edu/cms/accountadder/) and complete the instructions.

After creating an account, you can also get a door code for the main CAEDM lab, [here](https://caedm.et.byu.edu/cms/doorcode.php). (After clicking the link, you may have to log in and then click the link again.)

You can now use the lab computers and the J drive!

If you haven't made a CAEDM account on your own computer before coming to the lab, there are computers set up outside of room 423 in the Clyde that you can use to create an account.
