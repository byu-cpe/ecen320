title: Vivado Synthesis Tools
lab: Vivado

<!--
This lab replaces the Linux lab (they no longer need this due to ECEN 224)

Create a lab of Vivado, simulation, synthesis and download without requiring them to code. 
Give them the code.
Perhaps have them make a few small changes just to make sure they go through the exercises.
Focus on implementation and download (give them code)
Perform simulation?
