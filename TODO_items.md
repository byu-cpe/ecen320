# To Do List

* /tutorials/lab_01/laboratory_instructions: was written for in-person passoffs - change to how we will do that.
* /_labs/lab_01: need video to introduce the Basys3 board
* Need a /resources/alarm_fan.bit file
* /tutorials/lab_02/downloading_bitfile: need videos to show downloading methods
* /tutorials/lab_02/downloading_to_the_basys3_using_adept/: need videos to show downloading methods
* There are videos in /tutorials/lab_01 which I don't see links to in the actual lab assignment. The idea is to only move over things that are linked to.  We should go through them and decide if they should havelinks to them and include them. If not, then they should be removed...
* There are instructions in LINKCHECK.md on installing link checking.  It works on Mac OS X, someone needs to try installing and running on Linux.
* For each lab, need to carefully clarify how pass off should be done.  Some labs still require sign offs by the TAs, some don't. 
* Turned off the suggested-edits button in default.html until we figure out how to fix the link...

* Post expected run times for the testbench simulations

* Add a `make clean` rule - to clean out cruft in CAEDM.

* Lab 11 - everyone is confused by Receive and Received
    - "Follows closely Lab 9" - some took it too literally
    - Wait until middle of the stop bit to handshake
    - MUST, MUST 
    - Even when he said that it didn't click for most of them until he drew it out as a complete system
    - Maybe draw the entire Tx/Rcv system with hosts
    - Use req/ack instead of Send/Sent

* Tell the TA's to use breakout rooms when using Zoom. Otherwise, everyone can watch as they help students.

* Labs' completion time - the suggestion was made to survey a semester's responses on how long labs took and add that to the labs so that students would know what to expect.
